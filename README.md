# MyFirstReactJS
My first attempts at using ReactJS by following pre-existing tutorials (listed in README.md)

To create this project, I used the following code sources:

*https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html*
*https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html*
*https://sweetcode.io/hello-world-create-react-app-java-script/*
